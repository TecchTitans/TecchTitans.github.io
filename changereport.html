        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
        <p>After the project progressed through its revision process, it went through a series of enhancements aimed at improving user experience and gameplay mechanics, alongside addressing any issues faced during the testing stage of the development. This report provides all of the modifications made to the game by the team, highlighting the key aspects of the project, such as Requirements, Method selection and planning, Risk assessment and mitigation, and Architecture. The key aspects of the document will be described in greater detail as the document progresses, but for the purposes of this introduction, some of the related terms will be used.</p>
        <p>Our team used an approach where every task was documented in a local logbook, accessible by all the team members. This logbook detailed who was responsible for each task and the current stage of each task, such as whether it is open, closed, or still in process. This method allowed the team to effectively plan and keep track of the progress and changes made to any aspects of the project, including deliverables. Gantt charts were also used and played a crucial role in representing the schedule and dependencies of the tasks, making it easier to allocate time and resources efficiently.</p>
